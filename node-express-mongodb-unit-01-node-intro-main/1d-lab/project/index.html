    <title>Meet Wacine Vidal</title>

    <p>
        Bonjour! My name is Wacine pronounce Wah-Seen. Fairly new to the development space but a life long technology lover. My background has taken many turns. After graduating with a cybersecurity degree, I worked in finance and management for a few years. 
        
        I love physical activities such as hiking, running, or footbal. Yet, you can still catch me taking long walks in the city or at a muesum on the weekends enjoying my solitude. 

        Burgundy is the best color created and only people with good taste (like myself) enjoy thai or italian food.
